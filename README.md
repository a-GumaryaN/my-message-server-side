my-message application server side :
in this project we use node.js , typescript , socket.io (as real time connection tool) , graphql (hybride with rest as api language) , mongodb (with mongoose module as database) , JWT (as authentication token tool) , joi (as input validator) for build a secure complete messenger server-side.
